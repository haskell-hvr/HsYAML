## 0.2.0.0

This release incorporates the work from [Vijay Tadikamalla's GSOC 2019 Project](https://vijayphoenix.github.io/blog/gsoc-the-conclusion/).
Highlights of this major release include support for emitting YAML as
well as providing direct access to source locations throughout the
parsing pipeline for improved error reporting.

* Changes in `Data.YAML` module
    * YAML 1.2 Schema encoders ([#21](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/21))
    * New `ToYAML` class for encoding Haskell Data-types from which YAML nodes can be constructed ([#20](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/20))
        * New functions like `encodeNode`, `encodeNode'` for constructing AST
        * New functions like `encode`, `encode1`, `encodeStrict`, `encode1Strict` for supporting typeclass-based dumping
        * Some ToYAML instances and other api
    * Modify `typeMismatch` function to show error source location in error messages ([#19](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/19))
    * Provide location-aware `failAtNode` alternative to `fail`

* Changes in `Data.YAML.Event` module
    * Preserve and round-trip Comments at Event level([#24](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/24))
        * New  `Comment` Event to preserve comments while parsing
        * Some additional implementations to preserve and round-trip comments
    * Fix issue [#22](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/issues/22)
    * New `EvPos` type for recording event and their corresponding position ([#19](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/19))
    * Preserve Flow Mapping and Flow sequence ([#18](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/18))
    * Features to preserve Literal/Folded ScalarStyle ([#15](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/pull/15))
        * New `Chomp` type denoting Block Chomping Indicator
        * New `IndentOfs` type denoting Block Indentation Indicator
    * New `NodeStyle` type denoting flow/block style
    * `Event(SequenceStart,MappingStart)` constructors now record `NodeStyle`
    * `Style` type renamed to `ScalarType`
    * New `writeEvents` and `writeEventsText` function
    * `Event(DocumentStart)` now records YAML directive
    * Event parser now rejects duplicate/unsupported YAML/TAG
      directives as mandated by the YAML 1.2 specification

* Move some schema related definitions from `Data.YAML` into the new `Data.YAML.Schema` module

* Make `decode`, `decode1`, `decodeStrict`, `decode1Strict`, `decodeNode`, and `decodeNode'` treat
  duplicate keys (under the respective YAML schema) in YAML mappings
  as a loader-error (controllable via new
  `schemaResolverMappingDuplicates` schema property)

* Define `Generic` and `NFData` instances for most types

* Fix `X38W` testcase ([#13](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/issues/13), [#14](https://github.com/haskell-hvr/HsYAML/issues/14))

* Remove dependency on `dlist`

#### 0.1.1.2

* Tolerate BOM at *each* `l-document-prefix` (rather than only at the first one encountered in a YAML stream)
* Workaround broken `mtl-2.2.2` bundled in GHC 8.4.1 ([#1](https://github.com/hvr/HsYAML/issues/1))

* Minor optimizations

### 0.1.1.0
